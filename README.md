## Description of the Web Application

UTSearCh is a networking platform where U of T students can find other U of T students based on search criterias.

Users will need to sign up in order to access its features as we want to restrict usage to U of T students.

After signing in, users will be able to customize their profiles which contain a profile picture, brief description, and tags that will serve as filters when being searched by other users.

Users will be able to communicate and interact with one another by adding friends, sending messages, forming group chats, videocalling, and forming group forums, which would easily allow them to ask course-related questions or connect with new people. Users can add students to their Block List to stop receiving unwanted messages from them. Images can also be uploaded to chats and forums.

In the Search feature, users will be able to search for other students by specifying tags from their profiles to find those with certain characteristics/interests. Users can also search for other students that are within a certain distance from them, and can see the location of their friends on a map.

By connecting to their Google accounts, users can easily edit Google Docs while chatting.

Through the Random Chat feature, users will be randomly paired with another online student which will enable them to chat and videocall each other instantly.
